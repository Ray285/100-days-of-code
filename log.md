# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 05, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Rewrote courses module of my side project in ES6 and finished the the Python course on http://codeacademy.com. Also finished Section 5 of "NodeJS In Depth" on Udemy.

**Thoughts:** Overall I feel good, I still have a long ways to go to get my app ready to launch. Splitting my time between working on new features and fixing bugs in my project while also taking time to dive deeper into the JavaScript concepts that I don't fully understand yet is working well so far. I'm getting a much better understanding of code that was previously a black box.

### Day 2: January 06, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Added google analytics script to my site and converted more code to ES6. Got caught up with some git branch merging issues...not fun 

**Thoughts:** I feel like I'm making good progress. I need to review some best practices regarding how to setup my git workflow and maintain branches.

### Day 3: January 07, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Did a technical interview in python in addition to deploying a new version of my site. Not much focus on "learning" or reading through tutorials at least for today. 

**Thoughts:** I'm planning on doing a deep dive into git. I think that I have a lot of gray areas there and could benefit from dedicating some time to figure out how to effectively trouble shoot and track down bugs to the commits in which they were introduced.

### Day 4: January 08, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Spent most of my time today resolving bugs and server errors when trying to deploy a new version of my site. I was able to track down and fix a very suddle bug that I accidentally introduced in a previous commit so that's good.

**Thoughts:** Feeling good, making good progress, just gotta keep it up.
