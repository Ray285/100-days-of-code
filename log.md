# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 05, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Rewrote courses module of my side project in ES6 and finished the the Python course on http://codeacademy.com. Also finished Section 5 of "NodeJS In Depth" on Udemy.

**Thoughts:** Overall I feel good, I still have a long ways to go to get my app ready to launch. Splitting my time between working on new features and fixing bugs in my project while also taking time to dive deeper into the JavaScript concepts that I don't fully understand yet is working well so far. I'm getting a much better understanding of code that was previously a black box.

### Day 2: January 06, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Added google analytics script to my site and converted more code to ES6. Got caught up with some git branch merging issues...not fun 

**Thoughts:** I feel like I'm making good progress. I need to review some best practices regarding how to setup my git workflow and maintain branches.

### Day 3: January 07, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Did a technical interview in python in addition to deploying a new version of my site. Not much focus on "learning" or reading through tutorials at least for today. 

**Thoughts:** I'm planning on doing a deep dive into git. I think that I have a lot of gray areas there and could benefit from dedicating some time to figure out how to effectively trouble shoot and track down bugs to the commits in which they were introduced.

### Day 4: January 08, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Spent most of my time today resolving bugs and server errors when trying to deploy a new version of my site. I was able to track down and fix a very suddle bug that I accidentally introduced in a previous commit so that's good.

**Thoughts:** Feeling good, making good progress, just gotta keep it up.

### Day 5: January 09, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Spent some time refactoring my Express routes in my app with ES6 and ran into some issues with my passport configuration. 

**Thoughts:** I'm starting to think that the asynchronous side of Javascript was intentionally designed by a very sick, evil, and disturbing human being. I'm also starting to develop insomnia...so far so good though.

### Day 6: January 10, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Fixed my authentication issue. It turned out to be a issue with a recent update to version 4.6.6 of mongoose. 

**Thoughts:** I'm making good progress, however I do think that I'll need to find a good balance soon between trying to learn and retain new concepts (especially in javascript) and building out features in my application.

### Day 7: January 11, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Wrote some unit tests in mocha as well as spent some time learning about the Node.js event loop.

**Thoughts:** Feeling good. I still need to work on how I divide my time between day to day progress and learning new concepts.

### Day 8: January 12, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Cleaned up my error handling code in express and implemented all CRUD functionality in my assignments module of tassly.

**Thoughts:** I'm making good progress. I've been gaining a much better understanding of the frameworks and libraries that my app relies on as I continue to build new features, refactor old code, and look for best practices.

### Day 9: January 14, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Refactored the assignment model on the Angular side of my app. Looks like there is a lot of code that will need to be changed in all of the models.

**Thoughts:**  Progress is still goood. I'm learning to be a little more patient with improving. I'm also starting to catch and fix a lot of mistakes that I made early on in developing my app, because I have a much better understanding of how everything works.

### Day 10: January 15, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Made some changes to my assignment model in my mongoose schema and made a lot of updates to the front-end for editing, creating, and deleting assignments to more easily update the UI. I also had to do some refactoring in my assignments route to check for empty requests, send back a copy of the modified assignment in the response, and a few other minor changes.

**Thoughts:** I'm learning to embrace the process of struggling with a problem and rethinking my approach until I figure it out and solve it.

### Day 11: January 16, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Most of today was focused on learning best practices and approaches to design a data model in MongoDB. I also spent some time learning about Node.js Streams, Buffers, and Pipes. I made a few modifications to my routes, but nothing major in terms of changes.

**Thoughts:** I'm focusing on really trying to understand as much of the inner workings of the code that I write (or borrow from elsewhere) in my application. So far so good. Still a long way to go, just have to embrace the process and keep going.

### Day 12: January 17, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Setup logging with winston in my backend. Did some research before hand on best practices and how the library works in general. Also, spent some time watching videos in my bash course on Udemy.

**Thoughts:** Nothing major today. Still focusing on developing a deeper understanding of Node and the other technologies that I'm working with.

### Day 13: January 18, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Got my environment setup with Meteor.js for another side project that I'll be helping with. Also, did some more logging cleanup and refactoring in my main app.

**Thoughts:** Tired...

### Day 14: January 19, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Even more logging cleanup and refactoring in my main app, mostly using ES6 Syntax in my routes.

**Thoughts:** Progress good. Work seems to be paying off in terms of my general development and problem solving skills. I'm getting much better at understanding documentation of the libraries that I use in my app, and even diving into the source code to track down problems when needed.

### Day 15: January 20, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Lots of refactoring. Trying to convert as much node code as possible over to ES6 where applicable. Also, did some form validation in my angular client side code.

**Thoughts:** Today was pretty productive. Still trying to figure out a rhythm in terms of learning vs doing, but so far so good.

### Day 16: January 21, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Mostly learning today. Spent some time learning about the node.js 'http' module as well as a few new things about TCP/IP, mime types, template engines, and bash scripts. Also, did a little tweaking to the mobile styling on my landing page and main page of my app.

**Thoughts:** So far so good. Embracing the process and taking it one day at a time.

### Day 17: January 23, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Made some UI improvements to the assignment create form for my application. Brought in a datepicker for due date, and a tag search component for setting the subject. Few minor styling tweaks as well.

**Thoughts:** So far so good. I need to spend some time going back and reviewing responsive web design and how to optimize images across different screen sizes.

### Day 18: January 24, 2017


**Today's Progress**: More UI changes. Modified my create assignment form to restrict the user's ability to submit until all field have been filled out. Also, started to layout the updates and important notifications part of the main screen.

**Thoughts:** Feeling good. I can see my own progress and improvement (although slowly) a little more each day.

### Day 19: January 25, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Even more UI Changes today. Refactored my create and edit assignment form into the same component. Still ironing out some minor issues.

**Thoughts:** Exhausted.

### Day 20: January 26, 2017


**Today's Progress**: I spent most of my time learning more about Node.js streams. I also worked on an interview practice question in python in order to make sure I'm retaining what I've learned so far.

**Thoughts:** I'm going to try and setup a plan that I can follow for this challenge in order to make sure that in addition to practicing coding, I'm able to go back and review previously learned concepts. Other than that everything is going good.

### Day 21: January 30, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Worked on some UI changes with Angular UI bootstrap. Implemented a confirmation modal along with the corresponding state and component for when a user deletes an assignment.

**Thoughts:** Things are going good. I got off track a little bit over the weekend due to moving but I'm right back at it today. I think the break may have actually been beneficial so that I could come back and start fresh.
