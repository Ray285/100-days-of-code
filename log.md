# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 05, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Rewrote courses module of my side project in ES6 and finished the the Python course on http://codeacademy.com. Also finished Section 5 of "NodeJS In Depth" on Udemy.

**Thoughts:** Overall I feel good, I still have a long ways to go to get my app ready to launch. Splitting my time between working on new features and fixing bugs in my project while also taking time to dive deeper into the JavaScript concepts that I don't fully understand yet is working well so far. I'm getting a much better understanding of code that was previously a black box.
