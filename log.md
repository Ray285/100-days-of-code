# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 05, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Rewrote courses module of my side project in ES6 and finished the the Python course on http://codeacademy.com. Also finished Section 5 of "NodeJS In Depth" on Udemy.

**Thoughts:** Overall I feel good, I still have a long ways to go to get my app ready to launch. Splitting my time between working on new features and fixing bugs in my project while also taking time to dive deeper into the JavaScript concepts that I don't fully understand yet is working well so far. I'm getting a much better understanding of code that was previously a black box.

### Day 2: January 06, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Added google analytics script to my site and converted more code to ES6. Got caught up with some git branch merging issues...not fun 

**Thoughts:** I feel like I'm making good progress. I need to review some best practices regarding how to setup my git workflow and maintain branches.

### Day 3: January 07, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Did a technical interview in python in addition to deploying a new version of my site. Not much focus on "learning" or reading through tutorials at least for today. 

**Thoughts:** I'm planning on doing a deep dive into git. I think that I have a lot of gray areas there and could benefit from dedicating some time to figure out how to effectively trouble shoot and track down bugs to the commits in which they were introduced.

### Day 4: January 08, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Spent most of my time today resolving bugs and server errors when trying to deploy a new version of my site. I was able to track down and fix a very suddle bug that I accidentally introduced in a previous commit so that's good.

**Thoughts:** Feeling good, making good progress, just gotta keep it up.

### Day 5: January 09, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Spent some time refactoring my Express routes in my app with ES6 and ran into some issues with my passport configuration. 

**Thoughts:** I'm starting to think that the asynchronous side of Javascript was intentionally designed by a very sick, evil, and disturbing human being. I'm also starting to develop insomnia...so far so good though.

### Day 6: January 10, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Fixed my authentication issue. It turned out to be a issue with a recent update to version 4.6.6 of mongoose. 

**Thoughts:** I'm making good progress, however I do think that I'll need to find a good balance soon between trying to learn and retain new concepts (especially in javascript) and building out features in my application.

### Day 7: January 11, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Wrote some unit tests in mocha as well as spent some time learning about the Node.js event loop.

**Thoughts:** Feeling good. I still need to work on how I divide my time between day to day progress and learning new concepts.

### Day 8: January 12, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Cleaned up my error handling code in express and implemented all CRUD functionality in my assignments module of tassly.

**Thoughts:** I'm making good progress. I've been gaining a much better understanding of the frameworks and libraries that my app relies on as I continue to build new features, refactor old code, and look for best practices.

### Day 8: January 14, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Refactored the assignment model on the Angular side of my app. Looks like there is a lot of code that will need to be changed in all of the models.

**Thoughts:**  Progress is still goood. I'm learning to be a little more patient with improving. I'm also starting to catch and fix a lot of mistakes that I made early on in developing my app, because I have a much better understanding of how everything works.
